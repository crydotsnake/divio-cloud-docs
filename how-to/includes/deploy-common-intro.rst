This document will take you step-by-step through the tasks required to deploy a portable, vendor-neutral application,
to Divio using Docker. The application architecture we adopt is in line with `Twelve-factor
<https://www.12factor.net/config>`_ design principles.

This guide will help you adapt an existing project for Docker or check that your existing Docker application will run
on Divio. Note that exact steps you need to take may depend on details of your application.
